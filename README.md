# Hello, I'm Milena! 😎

## 🙋‍♂️ About me

<p align="justify">I've worked as a physiotherapist for a few years, but I've decided to make a career change and focus on software testing. As a former physiotherapist,
I've always enjoyed solving complex problems. I believe that my analytical skills and attention to detail will serve me well in my new career path as a software 
tester.

I'm currently working on building my skills in testing and quality assurance, and I'm always eager to learn more. I believe that software testing is a crucial part of 
the software development process and plays an important role in ensuring that software is of high quality and meets the needs of end-users.

I enjoy using various testing frameworks and tools, and I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills and knowledge. My goal is to become a skilled software tester 
and to contribute to the development of high-quality software products.</p>
